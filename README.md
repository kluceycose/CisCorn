# CisCorn
Simple tool to show interface info from Cisco device connected serially

This was written during an internship between projects as a demonstration of my understanding
 of both Python and Cisco networking commands.
 
Further development would include filtering the different segments of a "show run" command,
 SSH Connection support, and then adding support for more commands.
